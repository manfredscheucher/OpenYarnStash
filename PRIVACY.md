**Last updated:** 2025-11-08

OpenYarnStash stores **all data locally on your device**. We do **not** use servers, Google Drive or any cloud services.

## What we store

## What we don’t do
- No account creation
- No cloud sync or remote servers
- No analytics, tracking, or ads
- No third-party data sharing

## Backup & transfer
- You can **export** your data to a ZIP file and **import** it on another device.
- Exported files are stored outside the app and are protected by your device’s file system and settings.

## Permissions & network
- The app may request file access to perform ZIP export/import.
- The app does **not** require an internet connection.

## Data deletion
- You can delete items in the app at any time.
- Uninstalling the app removes local app data (manually created export files remain on your device until you delete them).

## Security
