# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2025-11-08

OpenYarnStash stores **only the data you explicitly enter** and keeps it **100% on your device**.  
**No data ever leaves your device** unless you choose to export it.

## Data we store (locally only)
- Yarns
- Projects
- Related notes/images/metadata

## What we don’t do
- No servers, no Google Drive, no cloud sync
- No accounts, no analytics/telemetry, no ads
- No third-party data sharing

## Where your data lives
All app data is saved in the app’s local storage on your device and remains under your control.  
Nothing is uploaded or transmitted in the background.

## Backup & transfer
- You can **export** your data to a ZIP file and **import** it on another device.
- Exported ZIP files are saved outside the app and are protected by your device’s file system and settings.

## Permissions & network
- File access is requested **only** to perform ZIP export/import.
- The app does **not** require an internet connection for normal use.

## Data deletion
- You can delete items at any time within the app.
- Uninstalling the app removes local app data (manually exported ZIP files remain until you delete them).

## Security
Your data stays on your device. Protect it with your **device security** (screen lock, OS updates, local backups).
