# OpenYarnStash

**OpenYarnStash** is an app to manage your yarn stash and knitting projects. It gives you a clear overview of your inventory and projects, plus helpful statistics—such as yarn usage and completed projects over time.

We only recently started development and have more features planned. We’d love your feedback anytime (preferably by email). Since OpenYarnStash is developed as [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software), you can explore the entire source code, build it yourself, and you’re welcome to contribute.

Built with [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)#Multiplatform) and [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/), the project targets Android, iOS, Web, and desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux) from a single codebase—with minimal per-target overhead.

We’re a team of two, so our primary focus is Android. Other targets may not yet be supported or may behave differently. Thanks for your understanding—and please report issues so we can fix them.

## Getting started

See **[BUILDING.md](./BUILDING.md)** for platform-specific build and run instructions.
