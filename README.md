# OpenYarnStash

**OpenYarnStash** is an open-source app for managing your yarn stash and knitting projects. 
It provides a clear overview of your inventory and projects, along with helpful statistics like yarn usage and completed projects over time. 
It gives you full control - all data is only stored locally on your device, and you can manually export and import to other devices.

As an [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) project, you can explore the full source code, build it yourself, and you are welcome to contribute.

OpenYarnStash is built with [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)#Multiplatform) and [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/), 
and targets Android, iOS, Web, and desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux) from a single codebase with minimal platform-specific overhead.
However, since we are only two developers, for the initial phase we only focus on the Android app. 
Other platforms may not yet be fully supported or could behave differently. 
We appreciate your understanding and encourage you to report any issues - in case you experience one -  so we can address them.
